# Palette

Before using the card1-ui components, you will need to use the following components:

## palette
This object is what all card1-ui components use to access color, which can be produced
by having the component being a child of a PaletteProvider, while also calling the 
usePalette function.

Here are the colors that we use, in order from primary to tertiary:

### Dark Theme
<ColorPalette>
  <ColorItem
    title="Base Colors"
    colors={{ dark: '#1C1C1C', dark2: '#262626', lightGrey: '#7D7D7D' }}
  />
  <ColorItem 
    title="Text Colors" 
    colors={{ white: '#FFFFFF', white: '#FFFFFF' }} 
  />
</ColorPalette>
**TODO:** Choose better colors

### Light Theme
**TODO:** WIP

### Structure
Here is what the current `palette` structure looks like:
```
base: {
    primary: dark,
    secondary: dark2,
    tertiary: lightGrey,
},
text: {
    primary: white,
    secondary: white
}
```

## usePalette
**Returns:** `{ palette }`

Currently, usePalette returns the current palette depending on what the current theme is.
If you want to use the colors that card1-ui follows, calling this function will get you
all necessary colors.

**Note/Todo:** Currently setting colors have not been implemented, as this is supposed to
be a component library with a set of colors already established. If the colors will forever
be the same, we'll probably just use a constant and remove PaletteProvider as a requirement
(except for theme switching).

## useTheme 

**Returns:** `{ theme, setTheme }`

This will allow you to toggle and set themes. `theme` will tell you which theme 
it currently is (`'dark'` or `'light'`)

## PalleteProvider

This will allow all child elements to be able to access the functions `useTheme` 
and `usePalette` which are necessary for card1-ui components, since that's where
they get their color from.

Here is an example:
```tsx
import { PaletteProvider } from 'card1-ui';

const Example = () => (
<PaletteProvider>
    <Typography textType="h1">
      Hello world!
    </Typography>
    <Typography textType="p">
      The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    </Typography>
</PaletteProvider>
);
```
